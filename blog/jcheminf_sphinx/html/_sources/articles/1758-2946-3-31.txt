Statistical filtering for NMR based structure generation

The constitutional assignment of natural products by NMR spectroscopy is usually based on 2D NMR experiments like COSY, HSQC, and HMBC. The difficulty of a structure elucidation problem depends more on the type of the investigated molecule than on its size. Saturated compounds can usually be assigned unambiguously by hand using only COSY and \ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC data, whereas condensed heterocycles are problematic due to their lack of protons that could show interatomic connectivities. Different computer programs were developed to aid in the structural assignment process, one of them C

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is the most common tool used for the structure elucidation of new compounds. The used 2D NMR experiments like COSY, HSQC, and \ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC deliver correlation information between atoms that can be translated into connectivity information. Out of these, correlation information from COSY and HSQC experiments can be transcribed directly into connectivity between atoms. But the \ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC correlations need more attention because of their ambiguity and complexity. Hence the difficulty of the structure elucidation problem depends more on the type of the investigated molecule than on its size. Saturated compounds can usually be assigned unambiguously using mainly COSY and some \ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC data, whereas condensed heterocycles are problematic due to their lack of protons that could show interatomic connectivities. This ambiguity has driven the development of different software packages to aid in the interpretation of the \ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC correlation data \ [#B1]_\ [#B2]_\ [#B3]_\ [#B4]_\ [#B5]_\ [#B6]_\ [#B7]_\ [#B8]_\ [#B9]_\ [#B10]_\ [#B11]_\ [#B12]_\ [#B13]_\ [#B14]_\ [#B15]_\ [#B16]_\ [#B17]_\ [#B18]_\ [#B19]_ as much as the development of additional correlation experiments \ [#B20]_\ [#B21]_.

When the observed connectivity information is used as input for the structure generation program C\ [#B3]_\ [#B22]_\ [#B23]_\ [#B24]_ it will create all compatible constitutional assignments. In the case of unsaturated molecules C\ [#B25]_\ [#B26]_ integrated to C`<http://cocon.nmr.de>`_), since it uses data protected by Intellectual Property. A different way of handling the result set had to be chosen, and the statistical filter was implemented.

The idea behind the filter is, to compare the suggested constitutions against existing molecules, like the ones contained in the PubChem (PubChem can be found at `<http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_) database. For each C`<http://www.chembiogrid.org/cheminfo/smi23d/>`_) has been used to generate 3D coordinates for almost 13M compounds contained in PubChem (The corresponding 3D coordinates generated by smi23d can be found at `<http://www.chembiogrid.org/cheminfo/p3d/>`_; the error observed is ~ 0.4% (= 53.000) false negatives for 13M compounds) and succeeded on generating coordinates for 99.6% of the molecules contained in the Database. The filtering application actually uses smi23d to generate 3D coordinates for all constitutional assignments generated by C**1** and **2**. For **3** the longest running time was 3 days for the generation of the 523.668 constitutional assignments using COSY, \ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC correlations and open atom types. A webpage allowing direct access to the results of the structure generator runs presented here has been set up on the `<http://cocon.nmr.de/StatisticalFilter/>`_ (The results are also mirrored at `<http://science.jotjot.net/StatisticalFilter/>`_).

Ascomycin is a well known ethyl derivative of Tacrolimus, it serves as example of a large natural product, featuring 43 Carbon atoms. Using experimental NMR correlation data (COSY and \ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC correlations) together with fixed atom types, C

The results change with the second example molecule, Aflatoxin B1 with 17 Carbon atoms. Using COSY and \ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC data alone, C\ :ref:`1<figure_1>`) all contain oxet-2-one as structural element, that can be found in 6 basic variations in 85 compounds in PubChem (see Figure \ :ref:`2<figure_2>`). Until now, no natural product has been described with this substructure. The numbers of results for the different C**1** and **2** are summarized in table \ :ref:`1<table_1>`. Oroidin **3** has been frequently used for the demonstration of C\ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC correlations lead to a total of 523.668 possible constitutional assignments, out of which only 1904 belong to the correct atom type combination. After the statistical filtering there are still 252.566 respectively 1486 suggestions left. In this case the reliable structure elucidation by NMR needs \ :sup:`15`\ N-HMBC or 1,1-ADEQUATE correlations. For calculations with open atom types, only when using both kinds of correlation information and filtering, a reasonable amount of 275 suggested constitutions is generated.

When the \ :sup:`15`\ N-HMBC correlations and fixed atom types are added to the COSY and \ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC based calculation the statistical filter excludes only the constitutional assignments containing the 1-nitro-prop-2-en-Z-ylidene substructural element (see Figure \ :ref:`3<figure_3>`). According to Beilstein, this structural element appears only 14 times, always in conjunction with an aromatic ring, as depicted in Figure \ :ref:`4<figure_4>`. When 1,1-ADEQUATE correlations are added instead, and atom types are fixed, the filter excludes 16 constitutions, shown in Figure \ :ref:`5<figure_5>`. All resulting numbers of constitutional assignments for the Different combinations of correlation data are summarized in table \ :ref:`2<table_2>`.

The results from tables \ :ref:`1<table_1>` and \ :ref:`2<table_2>` show that the filter excludes more constitutional assignments when the atom types are undefined (45% - 65%) then when the atom types are defined (~ 20%). In neither case the correct constitutions were excluded, and in the case of Ascomycin the filter did not exclude any constitutional assignment. The calculation time increases depending on the number of possible constitutional assignments, as smi23d runs about 0.5 s per structure. This explains the observed 3 days for the generation of the 523,668 constitutional assignments for Oroidin using COSY, \ :sup:`13`\ C-HMBC correlations and open atom types, C\ :ref:`2<table_2>`), looking at a mere 275 constitutional assignments instead of 716 is a considerable improvement. When looking at the excluded constitutions, and checking for the common structural elements, it turns out that they are not stable or do not exist in PubChem. Run times for the filter could be cut down in the future by restricting the MD run to just the generation of the parameters, but this would need changing the existing smi23d software package, and throwing away the possibility of improved visualization of the results with the 3D structures. The new statistical filtering presented here has already been made available in **1**, Aflatoxcin B1 **2** and Oroidin **3** (Figure \ :ref:`6<figure_6>`), example molecules that have already been used on other occasions. The molecules are available as examples on the
